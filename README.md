THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED FOR THE ML MATRIX 24-HOUR HACKATHON CONDUCTED BY BMSCE IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY ON 19TH OCTOBER, 2024

PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Manual diagnosis is time-consuming, so there's a need for an automated system to diagnose diseases from symptoms, providing efficient and accurate support.

ABSTRACT
- Manual disease diagnosis can often lead to long waiting times for patients. This project aims to automate the diagnostic process using a machine-learning model that analyzes symptoms and test results. The model is capable of predicting 41 diseases, including AIDS, arthritis, jaundice, and more, improving efficiency and accuracy.
